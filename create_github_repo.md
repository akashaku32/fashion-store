# Creating GitHub Repository - Step by Step

## Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and login
2. Click the "+" icon in top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `ladies-clothing-store` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: `Modern Django e-commerce application for ladies clothing store`
   - **Visibility**: Public (for free deployment services)
   - **DON'T** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Run these in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ladies-clothing-store.git

# Rename the default branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 2: Using GitHub CLI (if installed)

If you have GitHub CLI installed, you can create the repository directly from the command line:

```bash
# Create repository and push (this will prompt for GitHub login)
gh repo create ladies-clothing-store --public --description "Modern Django e-commerce application for ladies clothing store" --push
```

## After Pushing to GitHub

Your repository will be available at:
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ladies-clothing-store`
